# Contributing to PropKub

## Quick Start

1. **Find an issue** you want to work on
2. **Check if someone is already assigned** - if yes, look for another issue
3. **Comment to show interest** - we assign based on first come, first serve
4. **Wait for assignment** - don't start coding until you're assigned
5. **Fork the repository**
6. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
7. **Make your changes**
8. **Test your changes**
9. **Submit a pull request** to `main`

**Important:** We work on assignment basis, not "first PR wins"!

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
